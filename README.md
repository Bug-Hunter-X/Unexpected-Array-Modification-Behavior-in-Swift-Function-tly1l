This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Swift related to array modifications within a function. The bug arises due to a misunderstanding of how Swift handles array parameters by default (pass-by-value).  A function designed to modify an array in place may return the original, unmodified array unexpectedly, which might cause issues with correctness and debugging. The solution illustrates the correct way to modify arrays in place using the `inout` keyword.
